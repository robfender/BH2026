  <p class="mb-4">
    BLACKHOLISTIC 2026 is an attenmpt to bring together diverse strands of scientisits working on black holes who often have the same astrophysics but very different knowledge.
    We hope to clarify the picture of how accretion and jet formation in black holes proceeds, across the black hole mass and mass accretion rate spectra, and to understand how these can 
    be efficiently implemented into cosmological simulations.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The conference is the first to be partially funded, and associated with, the ERC Synergy Grant BLACKHOLISTIC (Principal Investigators: Heino Falcke, Rob Fender, Sera Markoff). 
    It also owes a debt of gratitude to, and is a partial continuation of, the SHIVA series of meetings which regularly investigate the connection between accretion in stellar mass black holes and those in 
    active galactic nuclei. Organisers Francesca Panessa and Jiri Svoboda are key members of the SHIVA team.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    The conference will take place in Oxford from March 23–27, 2026, and will feature a mix
    of invited talks, contributed sessions, and open-ended discussions. We especially
    encourage participation from early-career scientists and underrepresented groups.
